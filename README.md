In the code I have coded the 2 LED's one will be constantly green as a power indcator and the other flashes red for 100ms every time a key is pressed mainly because i think it is cool but it will also help me debud why its not working in the case that it doesent work.

I will be useing:

--> 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040

--> 2x SK6812 MINI-E LED's

--> 4x MX-Style switches

--> 4x Keycaps
